        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Bursting with flavor, this pumpkin pie recipe is my very favorite. 
            It’s rich, smooth, and tastes incredible on my homemade pie crust 
            and served with whipped cream. The pie crust leaves are purely for 
            decor, you can leave those off of the pie and only make 1 pie crust.

        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the pie crust through step 5 according to my 
                <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/">
                directions, tips, and pictures.</a> Or use store-bought.</li>
            <li><strong>For the pumpkin pie filling:</strong> Whisk the 
                pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. 
                Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, 
                pepper, cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything 
                is combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out the chilled pie crust:</strong> Remove 
                1 disc of pie dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly 
                floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch 
                circle. Make sure to turn the dough about a quarter turn 
                after every few rolls. Carefully place the dough into a 
                <strong>9-inch deep dish pie dish.</strong> Tuck it in 
                with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small 
                and sharp knife, 
                trim the extra overhang of crust and discard. Crimp the 
                edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers, 
                if desired. Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture. 
                Line the pie crust with parchment paper. Crunching up 
                the parchment paper is helpful so that you can easily 
                shape it into the crust. Fill with pie weights or dried 
                beans. (Note that you will need at least 2 standard sets 
                of pie weights to fit.) Make sure the weights/beans are 
                evenly distributed around the pie dish. Par-bake the 
                crust for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment 
                paper/pie weights.</li>
                <li>Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm pre-baked 
                crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up. 
                <em>(If using a deep dish pie dish as instructed, 
                you should only have a little filling leftover. 
                Use extra to make mini pies with leftover pie dough 
                scraps if you’d like.)</em> Bake the pie until the 
                center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or 
                take. A small part of the center will be wobbly – 
                that’s ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to 
                cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or 
                use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from 
                getting too brown. Check for doneness at minute 50, 
                and then 55, and then 60, etc.</li>
                <li>Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and 
                allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours. 
                Decorate with and pie crust leaves. Serve pie with 
                whipped cream if desired. Cover leftovers tightly 
                and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
