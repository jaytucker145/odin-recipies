        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is enough for a double crust pie. If you only 
            need 1 crust for your pie, cut this recipe in half OR 
            freeze the other half per the make ahead tip instruction 
            below. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 and 1/2 cups (313g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons (90g) unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (148g) vegetable shortening, chilled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) ice water </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry cutter <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-Dough-Blender-Blades/dp/B000QJE48O?tag=sallsbakiaddi-20">(the one I own)</a> or two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). A pastry cutter makes this step very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) water since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and a little more in dry winter months (up to 3/4 cup). Do not add any more water than you need.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Using floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats. Form it into a ball. Cut dough in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands.</li>
            <li>Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days.</li>
            <li>When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs to use in your pie, always use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected!</li>
            <li>Proceed with the pie per your recipeâ€™s instructions.
